# Installation
## Scala and SBT on Ubuntu
* Just run the following command and it will download and install Scala and SBT. The version will be installed is specified in the `install-scala.sh` script file (It will be probably changed to fetch the latest version automatically later on).

```shell
curl -Lo- https://goo.gl/lYN6xn | bash 
```
